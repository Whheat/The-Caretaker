A BCI platform based on my personal findings and ideas, I am not a professional.

**What is a BCI?**
A BCI, or Brain-Computer Interface, is a device that connects your brain to a computer and allows them to exchange information. Currently, this exchange is only one-way, with only the computer able to get information from the brain and not vice versa. In layman's terms, the human brain is read-only. There are two types of BCIs: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive is defined as a surgical implant in the brain. Neuralink is an Invasive BCI. The issue with Invasive BCIs is that these surgeries are currently among the most dangerous surgeries possible. For things like Neuralink to become widespread, medical tech would have to improve or thousands would die due to the inherent dangers of the surgery. The main benefit of invasive BCIs is that being integrated with the brain increases the speed, purity, and amount of information that can be acquired. Non-invasive BCIs are far safer and more accessible options as they sit on your head and use electrical signals communicated through the brain to obtain information, with no surgery required. However, non-invasive BCIs cannot read nearly as many signals as invasive BCIs can.
